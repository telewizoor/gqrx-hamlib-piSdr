# gqrx-hamlib - a gqrx to Hamlib interface to keep frequency
# between gqrx and a radio in sync when using gqrx as a panadaptor
# using Hamlib to control the radio
#
# The Hamlib daemon (rigctld) must be running, gqrx started with
# the 'Remote Control via TCP' button clicked and
# comms to the radio working otherwise an error will occur when
# starting this program. Ports used are the defaults for gqrx and Hamlib.
#
# Return codes from gqrx and Hamlib are printed to stderr
#
# This program is written in Python 3.5
# Python libraries required are:
#   - socket
#   - sys
#   - getopt
#   - time
#   - xmlrpc.client
#
# To run it type the following on the command line in the directory where
# you have placed this file:
#   python3.5 ./gqrx-hamlib-fldigi.py [-f]
#
# The -f option will cause the program to tune fldigi to the gqrx frequency.
